## Graph-Induced Neighborhood Search Heuristic


This repository contains all of the test instances and test results were used in the paper "A graph-induced neighborhood search heuristic for the capacitated multicommodity network design problem".

## Test Instances

The test instances contains three subfolders corresponding to each of the three link models. Each subfolder contains 81 randomly generated instances.

## Test Results

Include all original experimental results to support the conclusions in the paper. The results consist of three subfolders corresponding to the three different link models. The suffix of the test result for each specific instance is ".out.gz", and the result file name one-to-one correspondence the specific test instance. Furthermore, each of the five parameter settings is placed in a separate subfolder.
